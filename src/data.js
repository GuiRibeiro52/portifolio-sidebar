The website includes:\n🎬 Films and series with complete details (cast, trailers, where to watch).\n📅 Seasons and episodes with pagination for efficient navigation.\n🔍 Smart search, searching for films, series and genres.\n✨ Themed sections such as Marvel Universe, Star Wars, and Harry Potter.\n💻 Automatic and responsive carousels for a great experience on any device. \n\nI used the TMDb API to integrate real data, such as titles, trailers and cast.",
